# Northgard Clans

What is this all about?

A little background...

While looking for some inspiration on what I should make for submission, I stumbled upon a video about this game called Northgard in my YouTube algorithm and apparently I also played this game a while ago.

So yeah, I am looking into Northgard wiki and found an interesting format, yes it's how the image can be next to the text that catch my interest, so I thought I can remake it as Jetpack Compose component.

## Submission Details

- [x] Home screen should display list of 10 or more items containing image, title and overview
- [x] List item should redirect to detail screen if clicked
- [x] Detail screen should contain expanded information from the list item in home screen and must use scrollable layout
- [x] Button for redirecting to about me screen. About me screen should contains image, name, and email as in your Dicoding Account.
